/**
 * There are several types of messages, that must be confirmed by the counter part.
 * For example, "SetIncomingTrustLineMessage" must be confirmed as processed by the remote node,
 * otherwise, current node must re-send it until remote node would not process it and send confirmation back.
 *
 * This mechanism allows to force processing of some events by the remote nodes,
 * and is useful for preventing various types of desynchronisations.
 *
 * This handler is used for storing and processing queues of the messages,
 * that must be confirmed by the remote nodes. Messages are sent once in a timeout.
 * This timeout exponentially increases after each one sending attempt,
 * to prevent heavy traffic usage against nodes, that are offline.
 *
 * Each remote node has it's own queue and it's own timeout.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * ToDo: "I'm online" message.
 * In case if remote node would be offline long period of time - timeout interval on current node would grow
 * up to 10+ minutes. Theoretically, it is possible, that remote node would come back online right after
 * failed sending attempt, so the next message would be sent to it after 10+ minutes.
 *
 * But, it would be much more efficient, if remote node might send "I'm online message" to it's contractors,
 * and them would know that it's time to try to send postponed messages once more.
